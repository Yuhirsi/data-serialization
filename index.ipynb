You read data into Python, extracted the relevant information, cleaned the data, and combined the data into a new format to be used in analysis. While we will continue to introduce new tools and techniques, these essential steps will be present for the rest of your data science projects from here on out!"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.1"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"a29b588f2870902796961df27edbcc50afa238bafed2ccf53a8493c03775ced4"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
